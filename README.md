# ForecastDatasetsHomework
My University's Data Structures and Algorithms homework. 

In this homework we did together with Industrial Engineering students, we apply 4 different estimation methods to datasets containing sales figures for 2 years, find the MSE values ​​and choose the most optimal method. Then, using this method, we can analyze our sales forecasts for the next 2 years month by month.

These 4 methods are:
-Exponential Smoothing
-Double-Exponential Smoothing
-Regression Analysis
-Deseasonalized Regression Analysis
